<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    I'm a Software Engineer located in Hyderabad, India. I have a serious passion for well executed cod and bug fixing.
    I like to code things from scratch and enjoy bringing ideas to life in the browser.
    I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself and do interesting stuff.
    I like to develop expertise in a number of areas over the course of my life and career.

    In my free time, I love to spend time my family, try new coffee shops and binge watch my favourite thrillers.
